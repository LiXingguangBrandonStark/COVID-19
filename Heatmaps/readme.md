**Visualising the spread of the pandemic**.<br><br>
[English LA Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/English%20LA%20Heatmaps.R) generates heatmaps and animated maps showing English Upper Tier Local Authority trajectories in both confirmed COVID-19 cases and estimated COVID-19 deaths (in hospitals only) inspired by similar plots for US states from [@Marco_Piani](https://twitter.com/Marco_Piani). The approach to modelling deaths, which are only published at NHS trust level, was developed by [@Benj_Barr](https://twitter.com/Benj_Barr). The code also generates a map of Local Authority-level changes in case numbers in the past week and animated maps of both case and death counts.<br><br>
[UK Hex Animation.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/UK%20Hex%20Animations.R) uses this data to generate an animated hex map of COVID-19 cases across the UK & Ireland, built on various excellent hex map resources from [@ODILeeds](https://twitter.com/ODILeeds) and [@olihawkins](https://twitter.com/olihawkins).<br><br>
[COVIDLACaseData.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDLACaseData.R) generates similar outputs, including for hospital admissions, at Lower Tier Local Authority level.<br><br>
[Scottish HB Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/Scottish%20HB%20Heatmaps.R), [Welsh LA Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/Welsh%20LA%20Heatmaps.R), [Irish County Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/Irish%20County%20Heatmaps.R) and [German State Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/German%20State%20Heatmaps.R) produce equivalent case trajectory plots for Scottish Health Boards, Welsh Local Authorities, Irish Counties and German Bundesl√§nder respectively.<br><br>
[COVIDPHESurveillance.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPHESurveillance.R) and [COVIDPHESurveillance2.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPHESurveillance2.R) provide analysis of the PHE Surveillance reports, including case data and positivity rates by age, although these have largely been replaced by [COVIDPHECasesxAgev2](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPHECasesxAgev2.R) which generates similar plots now that age-specific case data at Local Authority level is published as part of [the PHE dashboard](http://coronavirus.data.gov.uk). [ScotlandCOVIDCasesxAge.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/ScotlandCOVIDCasesxAge.R) performs some similar analysis of case data by age for Scotland, alongside analysis of cases and deaths by deprivation quintile, while [ScotlandCOVIDHouseParties.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/ScotlandCOVIDHouseParties.R) is a small piece of analysis looking at data from Scotland on regulation-breaching house parties. Finally, [COVIDPillars.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPillars.R) is another, obsolete, approach using older, pre-dashboard API, data to separate out case trajectories by testing pillar, while [Misc Case Analysis.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/Misc%20Case%20Analysis.R) is a collection of various quick plots related to various aspects of case data.<br><br>
I've also made a couple of apps to allow you to explore local and national COVID-19 data. [One](https://victimofmaths.shinyapps.io/COVID_LA_Plots/) for mortality, cases and admissions data and [another](https://victimofmaths.shinyapps.io/COVID_Cases_By_Age/) for case data stratified by age.
