**Analysis of data on weekly all-cause mortality during the pandemic**<br><br>
[AllCauseDeaths.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/AllCauseDeaths.R) harmonises weekly all-cause mortality data from England & Wales (from ONS), Scotland (from NRS) and Northern Ireland (from NISRA) and draws plots comparing deaths in 2020 so far to the previous decade, split by age, sex and region inspired by a plot from [@EdConwaySky](https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky).
<br><br>[ScottishAllCauseDeathsDetail.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/ScottishAllCauseDeathsDetail.R) uses richer data published by NRS to look at patterns in excess mortality in Scotland by place of death, Health Board area and age. [NRS Excess Deaths by Cause.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/NRS%20Excess%20Deaths%20by%20Cause.R) produces graphs of excess deaths in Scotland by cause and location of death.<br><br>
[All Cause Deaths France.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/All%20Cause%20Deaths%20France.R) uses detailed French all-cause mortality records published by [Insee](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques), the French statistical authority, to examine age-specific excess deaths in France and [All Cause Deaths Italy.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/All%20Cause%20Deaths%20Italy.R) does the same for Italy using data from [ISTAT](https://www.istat.it/en/).<br>
[AllCauseDeathsxAge.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/AllCauseDeathsxAge.R) brings these together and extends this analysis using data from the UK and international data from the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/).<br><br>
[MSOA Deaths.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/MSOA%20Deaths.R) takes mortality data from England & Wales at Middle Super Output Area level and from Scotland at Intermediate Zone level and maps it, ready for 3D visualisation using [Aerialod](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod).<br><br>
[COVIDAgeMortPred.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/COVIDAgeMortPred.R) uses age-specific Case Fatality Ratios estimated by [Daniel Howden](https://twitter.com/danielhowdon) to estimate the future burden of mortality from COVID-19 infections that have already been identified (i.e. the total number of deaths we'd expect in England over the next few months *assuming there were no further infections*).<br><br>
[LA All Cause Deaths.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/LA%20All%20Cause%20Deaths.R) calculates excess mortality at Local Authority level from ONS figures.
